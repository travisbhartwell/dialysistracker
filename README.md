# Dialysis Tracker

I have end stage renal disease and have done [Home Peritoneal Dialysis](https://homedialysis.org/home-dialysis-basics/peritoneal-dialysis) (or PD) every night since 2013. Associated with each treatment, I take a set of vitals, and then at the end of the night, I record the results of the session.

I have been keeping paper records of my treatments this whole time but really wanted an efficient means of tracking it on my computer, and thus I am creating this tool.
